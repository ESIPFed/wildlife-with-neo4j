Conservation organizations set priorities as a balance of their overall mission and the larger conservation needs.  As we craft conservation strategies across ever-larger landscape scales, we need to understand and incorporate conservation priorities that span different organizations, geographies, management plans, and jurisdictional boundaries.  
An integrative assessment of the linkages among organizational conservation priorities provides opportunities for effective planning to increase the impact of conservation investments.  

This project is an experiment with using the Neo4j graph databases to connect information and knowledge relevant to bird conservation planning and management activities.
